Our goal is to make the everconflicting information on the web more readable to people with learning difficulties.

After being provded with an image, the extension will provide text editor options; font type, size, color, text spacing, and density. The program will as have features to identify synonyms and definitions of words, text to speech, and the ability to gain a summary from the website.
